                You acknowledge and agree that the technical processing and
                transmission of the Products and Services, including your Content,
                 may involve
                 (a) transmissions over various networks; and
                 (b) changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of
                 connecting networks or devices.

                AGTM also may suspend or terminate any user account for any
                Product or Service because of user inactivity. For example,
                a AGTM account may be terminated or suspended if a user fails
                to sign-in to AGTM Service for an extended period of time;
                please see AGTM Rules and Regulation section for more information regarding
